# Solar Radiance Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting solar radiance using data analysis techniques in Python. The dataset contains historical solar radiation data, and the goal is to explore, clean, and model this data to accurately forecast solar radiance values.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the dataset to understand trends, patterns, and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Modeling:** Using machine learning algorithms to predict solar radiance.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the model with various metrics such as MSE and R².

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available and includes features such as:
- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Solar Radiance**
- **Wind Speed**

### Source:
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file that contains time-series data.
